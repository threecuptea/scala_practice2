/**
  * Telecoder is an example used in a session taught in "Functional Programming Principles in Scalaâ€™ course.
  * You can regard this as a preview of Anagrams assignment.  However, it won't go so far as Anagrams
  *
  *  1. charCodes: create a reverse map from alpha Char to number code
  *  2. wordCode: get number codes of a word
  *  3. wordsForNum: process dictionary and create a map with numeric tele-code as the key and all words associated with
  *     it as the value.
  *  4. encoder and translate take a tele-code as the input output then output words in sequence use that tele-code.
  *     For example, "7225247386". "7225" can translate into "rack", "sack", "pack". If you use the next 3 "247", you
  *     might get "air" and so on. If you use "24" only, you might get "ah".   You can also "72252" instead "7225", you
  *     will get "Scala".  In Anagrams,  In an "Occurrences":('a', 1), ('e', 1), ('m', 1) ('n', 1), ('s', 1), ('y', 1),
  *     you can start with any combination.  Here, you have to follow numeric tele-code in sequence.   It is simply "take n" and
  *     "drop n" operation.
  *
  * I practiced this on 2019-01
